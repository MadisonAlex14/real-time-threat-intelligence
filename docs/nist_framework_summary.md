# CSF and RMF summary and takeaways
## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0
[The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf)  
[Second Link - Summarized ](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/37/r2/final)

The CSF 2.0 is a guide to help organizations, including ours, manage and reduce cybersecurity risks. It's organized around six key functions:  

**1) Identify**: Understand our systems, assets, data, and risks.  
**2) Protect**: Implement safeguards to ensure critical services are delivered.  
**3) Detect**: Develop activities to identify cybersecurity events promptly.  
**4) Respond**: Establish plans to handle detected incidents effectively.  
**5) Recover**: Implement strategies to restore capabilities after an incident.    
**6) Govern**: Focus on our organization's leadership, policies, and oversight to manage cybersecurity risks.

This framework is flexible and can be tailored to fit our team's specific needs, helping us align our cybersecurity activities with our goals and resources.  

## NIST SP 800-37 Risk Management Framework (RMF)

The RMF provides a structured approach to managing security and privacy risks. It outlines a six-step process for us:

**1) Prepare**: Set the context and priorities for managing security and privacy risks.  
**2) Categorize**: Determine the impact levels of the information and systems we handle.  
**3) Select**: Choose appropriate security controls based on our risk assessment.  
**4) Implement**: Put the selected controls into action.  
**5) Assess**: Evaluate the effectiveness of these controls.  
**6) Authorize**: Decide if the system's risk levels are acceptable for operation.  
**7) Monitor**: Continuously oversee the system to manage any changes in risk.  

So if we follow these steps, we can be sure that our cybersecurity measures are robust and adaptable to evolving threats.  

## Key Takeaways for Our Team

**Comprehensive Approach**: Integrate both CSF and RMF into our practices to cover all bases—from identifying risks to continuous monitoring.  
**Customization**: Adapt these frameworks to fit our team's specific projects and challenges.  
**Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update our strategies to keep up with new threats and technologies.  
**Collaboration**: Work together, leveraging each member's strengths, to enhance our cybersecurity posture.  

We will embrace these frameworks, so that we’re better equipped to tackle security challenges effectively and efficiently.
